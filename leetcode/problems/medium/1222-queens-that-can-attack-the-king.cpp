Queens That Can Attack the King
https://leetcode.com/problems/queens-that-can-attack-the-king/

On an 8x8 chessboard, there can be multiple Black Queens and one White King.

Given an array of integer coordinates queens that represents the positions of the Black Queens, and a pair of coordinates king that represent the position of the White King, return the coordinates of all the queens (in any order) that can attack the King.

 

Example 1:



Input: queens = [[0,1],[1,0],[4,0],[0,4],[3,3],[2,4]], king = [0,0]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,3]]
Explanation:  
The queen at [0,1] can attack the king cause they're in the same row. 
The queen at [1,0] can attack the king cause they're in the same column. 
The queen at [3,3] can attack the king cause they're in the same diagnal. 
The queen at [0,4] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at [0,1]. 
The queen at [4,0] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at [1,0]. 
The queen at [2,4] can't attack the king cause it's not in the same row/column/diagnal as the king.
Example 2:



Input: queens = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[3,4],[3,5],[4,4],[4,5]], king = [3,3]
Output: [[2,2],[3,4],[4,4]]
Example 3:



Input: queens = [[5,6],[7,7],[2,1],[0,7],[1,6],[5,1],[3,7],[0,3],[4,0],[1,2],[6,3],[5,0],[0,4],[2,2],[1,1],[6,4],[5,4],[0,0],[2,6],[4,5],[5,2],[1,4],[7,5],[2,3],[0,5],[4,2],[1,0],[2,7],[0,1],[4,6],[6,1],[0,6],[4,3],[1,7]], king = [3,4]
Output: [[2,3],[1,4],[1,6],[3,7],[4,3],[5,4],[4,5]]
 

Constraints:

1 <= queens.length <= 63
queens[i].length == 2
0 <= queens[i][j] < 8
king.length == 2
0 <= king[0], king[1] < 8
At most one piece is allowed in a cell.
