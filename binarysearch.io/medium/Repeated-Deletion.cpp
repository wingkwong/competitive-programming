Repeated Deletion
https://binarysearch.io/problems/Repeated-Deletion

Given a string s, repeatedly delete the earliest consecutive duplicate characters.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of s.
Example 1
Input

s = "abbbaac"
Output

"c"
Explanation

"bbb" are the earliest consecutive duplicate characters which gets deleted. So we have "aaac".
"aaa" then gets deleted to end up with "c".
