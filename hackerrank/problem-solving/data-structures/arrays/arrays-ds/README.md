# [Arrays - DS](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/arrays-ds/problem)

An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. In an array, A, of size N, each memory location has some unique index, i (where 0<=i<N), that can be referenced as  A[i](you may also see it written as Ai).

Given an array,A, of N integers, print each element in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.

Note: If you've already solved our C++ domain's Arrays Introduction challenge, you may want to skip this.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, N (the number of integers in A).
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing A.

Sample Input
```
4
1 4 3 2
```

Sample Output
```
2 3 4 1
```

Read the input and print it in reverse.
