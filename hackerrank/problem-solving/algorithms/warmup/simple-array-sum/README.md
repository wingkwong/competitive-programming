# [Simple Array Sum](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/simple-array-sum/problem)

Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements. For example, if the array ar = [1,2,3], 1+2+3=6, so return 6.

Sample Input
```
6
1 2 3 4 10 11
```

Sample Output
```
31
```

Similar to  [A Very Big Sum](https://github.com/wingkwong/competitive-programming/tree/master/hackerrank/warmup/a-very-big-sum), but ``int`` is enough for this question.
