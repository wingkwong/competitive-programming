# [A Very Big Sum](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/a-very-big-sum/problem)

Calculate and print the sum of the elements in an array, keeping in mind that some of those integers may be quite large.

Sample Input
```
5
1000000001 1000000002 1000000003 1000000004 1000000005
```

Sample Output
```
5000000015
```

Nothing special. Read an input and sum them up. ``long`` should be enough in this case. Let's delete all the code provided by HackerRank. Copy and paste the template.
